setup instructions:

after copying this into a folder and renaming the dir, run 'python3 -m venv env' to create the venv

next, if you are using create the repo and create a .gitignore that ignores '.classes.py.swp' and 'env/'

next, run 'pip install --upgrade pip' and 'pip install --upgrade setuptools' and then finally run 'pip install pygame'

it should work now.
